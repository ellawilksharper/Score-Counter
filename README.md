<h1>Score Counter </h1> 

- This project incorporates HTML/CSS and Javascript to create a score counter. 
- Also played around with a colour changer interval in CSS.

- The project allows two players to click to the set winning score (ideal for keeping track of a game).
- You can also change the winning score.



Planning to update the CSS and add prompts/alerts when someone wins.
